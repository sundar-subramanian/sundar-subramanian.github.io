# Assignment 5.1 - Will The Customer Accept the Coupon?

This analysis explores drivers who were offered a coupon to an expensive restaurant (20-50 USD) and attempts to draw insights from the characteristics of those drivers to choose to accept the coupon.

The overall coupon acceptance rate for drivers who are offered this coupon is 45%. But this acceptance rate varies widely based on other characteristics of the drivers and their passengers. 

Further analysis reveals the following:

- Drivers driving with a partner are more likely to accept a coupon than others (63% vs 43%).
- Drivers who visit expensive restaurants at least once a month are more likely to accept a coupon to an expensive restaurant than others (56% to 39%).
- Drivers who receive a coupon than expires in 1 day rather than 2 hours are more likely to accept a coupon than others (52% to 31%).
- Drivers who do not have children are more likely to accept a coupon than drivers who have children (48% to 41%).
- Drivers who go to expensive restaurants more than once a month and have a bachelors and graduate degree are slightly more likely to accept the coupon than others (47% to 40%).
- Looking at education levels alone, high school graduates have the highest acceptance rate than most other groups.
- Drivers with partners as passengers have the highest acceptance rate (above 62%). Drivers with kids as passengers have the lowest acceptance rate (37%).
- Drivers with partners as passengers have the highest acceptance rate (above 62%). Drivers with kids as passengers have the lowest acceptance rate (37%). 
- Drivers who are of age 26 have the highest acceptance rate for restaurant coupons among all ages.
- Drivers who are single or have a partner (unmarried) have the highest acceptance rate for restaurant coupons (about 47%).
- Drivers who visit restaurants more often (regardless of whether they are cheaper or expensive ones) have a higher acceptance rate for restaurant coupons.
- Drivers who receive coupon between 10 AM and 6 PM are more likely to accept than those who receive the coupon at 10 PM or 7 AM.
- Drives who receive coupons to expensive restaurants, who are not on the way to work and who have a partner or friend as passenger are more likely to accept coupon.
- Drivers who are in Sales & Related occupation, are Single, do not have children have a higher acceptance rate than others.
- Drivers who are Female, who go to expensive restaurants more than once a month and whose income is more than 50k have a higher acceptance rate vs. others
- Drivers who are not going any place urgently, and are driving alone or with kids, have higher acceptance rate than others.
- Income levels are not reliable indicators of coupon acceptance rate.

Additional analysis may be performed to predict the likelihood of a driver accepting the coupon based on these characteristics. Some recomendations based on the above analysis to improve coupon acceptance rates:

- Offer coupons during the day 10-6, and those that expire in 1 day rather than 2 hours.
- Offer coupons to drivers who drive with a partner.
- Offer coupons to drivers who visit restaurants frequently. 
- Offer coupons to drivers who are single or have a partner (unmarried).
- Offer coupons to drivers who are in sales and related occupations.

Additional behavioral and demographic data may help in targeting the right audience.
